#### Special Thanks:
We would like to thank AstroMonk for coming up with a replacement idea for the last level,
deadfood for finding a leveljump and Coi for finding a non-planned vulnerability.

### Description:
This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common sense and some knowledge about basic *nix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from the players.
