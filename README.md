# Wargames and CTF Writeups
As I got more into making a website I started thinking about security considerations and what could go wrong. This lead me to finding CTFs and Wargames to practice penetration testing and learn something about how exploitable applications, frameworks, and websites are.

## Purpose
This is not to show off, this is just explaining how I thought about problems and solved them. It is also documenting my learning process.
